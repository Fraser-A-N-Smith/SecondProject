## Getting Started

There is no target folder because the eclipse install on the development PC has encountered a glitch and even a fresh install has not helped. The ECLIPSE IDE insists that a pom file does not exist when It quite clearly does, as is evidenced by the attached screenshots. As such to use the project, access the eclipse IDE and select the hobbyProject folder, then run it as a SpringBoot App.
